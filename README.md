# GATCGGenerator v1.0

## Description

GATCGGenerator allows to generate specific quasi-random nucleotide sequences. 
These are sequences without homopolymer regions with a given dinucleotides amount. 
It is available to specify the required number of sequences, their length, GC-composition, and the percentage of dinucleotides. 
In addition, the software allows sequences generation without homopolymer regions. 
The generator excludes the presence of repeating motifs from 2 to 5 nucleotides more than four times.
The GATCGGenerator allows to generate DNA and RNA sequences . The output is presented as a CSV file. 
The output table contains the following information: sequence, GC-composition, and quantitative content of each nucleotide.
